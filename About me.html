About me


</h1>

<h2>

My name is Peter Vuong and I have just completed my second year in mechanical engineering 
at the University of Toronto. I am an aspiring young student looking to specialize in the design and energy 
and environment streams, accompanied with a business minor. I scavenge for activities every day that
either aid my growth as an engineer or give back to the communities that have helped me flourish. 
Currently, I am giving back by volunteering as a

DEEP Counsellor

</a>

and as the External Events Coordinator for the 

<a href="http://harthouse.ca/chess-club/">

Hart House Chess Club

</a>
.

<h2>
From the days where I could begin to run, I had developed a penchant towards athletics. For the majority of
my life, sports were integral. I had witnessed my growth from barely cutting the middle school volleyball 
roster and grade nine basketball roster to captaining my high school volleyball team and participating in a
 basketball league. I used sports to encourage me in everyday life. As a captain, I felt like a role model
 to those on my team, and had felt like I had given back to the school that raised me for so long.

 
</h2>

<h2>
Once high school commenced, I started to develop interest in STEM related courses. Whether this was attributed
to more exposure to such courses or simply being connected with others who shared interest, my engineering
ambitions evoked here. I had ventured into areas where I was not necessarily comfortable in, from competing
in STEM contests to tutoring individuals and classes. 
</h2>

<h2>
By the time high school was over, I had won various awards and accolades, from volleyball MVP
to University of Toronto Scholar. But when I look at these accomplishments on my wall, I rarely ever 
think of how successful I was. Rather, I remember the people who helped me reach these goals. As an
engineer, I want to be apart of that feeling - to help a team towards a goal that will benefit others.
